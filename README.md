# Decision Tree Classifier: Customer Purchase Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic and behavioral data using the **Bank Marketing dataset** from the UCI Repository. The model is a decision tree classifier trained to analyze key features influencing customer behavior.

## Objectives
- Build and evaluate a decision tree classifier.
- Analyze feature importance.
- Visualize the model's performance.

## Dataset
Key features:
- **Age**, **Job**, **Marital Status**, **Education**, **Loan Information**, **Campaign Data**.
- Target: **Customer purchase (yes/no)**.
