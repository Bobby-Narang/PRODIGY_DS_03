Decision Tree Classifier: Customer Purchase Prediction
Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will purchase a product based on demographic and behavioral data using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Repository. The model is a decision tree classifier trained to analyze key features influencing customer behavior.

Objectives
Build and evaluate a decision tree classifier.
Analyze feature importance.
Visualize the model's performance.
